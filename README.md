## üí°Introduction 

In the previous View system, drawing Bitmap Image from `View` was very straightforward. But that's not the case with Jetpack Compose since it's different in many aspects from previous system. This library helps easy way to achieve the same results. 
It's built upon the `ComposeView` and uses `View`'s APIs to draw the Bitmap image.

## üöÄ Implementation

You can check [/app](/app) directory which includes example application for demonstration. 

### Gradle setup

In `build.gradle` of app module, include this dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "dev.shreyaspatil:capturable:1.0.1"
}
```

_You can find latest version and changelogs in the [releases](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/Capturable/releases)_.

### Usage

#### 1. Setup the controller

To be able to capture Composable content, you need instance of [`CaptureController`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Capturable/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/-capture-controller/index.html) by which you can decide when to capture the content. You can get the instance as follow.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TicketScreen() {
    val captureController = rememberCaptureController()
}
```

_[`rememberCaptureController()`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Capturable/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/remember-capture-controller.html) is a Composable function._

#### 2. Add the content

The component which needs to be captured should be placed inside [`Capturable`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Capturable/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable/-capturable-kt/-capturable.html) composable as follows.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TicketScreen() {
    val captureController = rememberCaptureController()
    
    Capturable(
        controller = captureController,
        onCaptured = { bitmap, error ->
           // This is captured bitmap of a content inside Capturable Composable.
           if (bitmap != null) {
               // Bitmap is captured successfully. Do something with it!
           }
            
            if (error != null) {
                // Error occurred. Handle it!
            }
        }
    ) {
        // Composable content to be captured.
        // Here, `MovieTicketContent()` will be get captured
        MovieTicketContent(...)
    }
}
```

#### 3. Capture the content

To capture the content, use [`CaptureController#capture()`](https://patilshreyas.github.io/Capturable/capturable/dev.shreyaspatil.capturable.controller/-capture-controller/capture.html) as follows. 

```kotlin
Button(onClick = { captureController.capture() }) { ... }
```

On calling this method, request for capturing the content will be sent and event will be received in callback `onCaptured` with `ImageBitmap` as a parameter in the `Capturable` function.

By default, it captures the Bitmap using [`Bitmap.Config`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config) **ARGB_8888**. If you want to modify, you can provide config from [`Bitmap.Config` enum](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Bitmap.Config).

Example:

```kotlin
captureController.capture(Bitmap.Config.ALPHA_8)
```

> _Make sure to call this method as a part of **callback function** and **not as a part of the Composable function itself**. Otherwise, it'll lead to capture bitmaps unnecessarily in recompositions which can degrade the performance of the application._

That's all needed!
